# Artifacts Analytics Tracking
BizTalk Server has the capabilities to perform tracking information at several levels:
 * Inbound and/or outbound event data. For example, message ID, start and stop times for the artifact.
 * Inbound and/or outbound message properties. For example, general and promoted properties for each message that the artifact processes.
 * Inbound and/or outbound message bodies and parts. For example, body and parts for each message that the artifact processes.
 * Orchestrations events. Execution data for orchestration shapes.
